# OpenFOAM-GUI

Designed a GUI for CFD software OpenFOAM, using the package PyFoam it also enables for easy variation of the given problem with a few clicks of the mouse in the GUI. Some code
is still missing for the GUI but the PyFoam variation is complete. It uses containers to connect to a remote server to make the calculations allowing for low-end hardware to still
succesfully use the software aswell as a website you can connect to.
