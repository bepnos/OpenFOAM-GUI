# OpenFOAM-GUI

Developed a GUI for CFD software OpenFOAM, using the package PyFoam it also enables for easy variation of the given problem with a few clicks of the mouse in the GUI. Some code
is still missing for the GUI but the PyFoam variation is complete. It uses containers to connect to a remote server to make the calculations allowing for low-end hardware to still
succesfully use the software aswell as a website you can connect to. Code and interface is primarily written in Dutch. It currently is set to the dambreak case which is described in the picture below

Some example variations are stored in the cloned-dambreak directories, these are viewable in software like ParaView. Simply open the .foam file in ParaView and choose how you want to view the case. 

Lastly the web directory contains a website version of the GUI using docker containers and the Flask library.
